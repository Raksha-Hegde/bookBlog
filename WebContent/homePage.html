				<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Treasure House of Knowledge. Books
					are wonderful gifts to mankind. Books are useful in many ways. They
					educate, entertain and serve as good companions when we are lonely.
					They guide us when we are confused. They inspire us when we are low
					in spirit. They are menâ€™s best friends. Books console us when we
					are in sorrow. We are never alone in the company of books. They
					demand nothing for the service they do to the mankind.</p>
				<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The kingdom of books is as vast as
					universe. There are books on literature, science, fiction, history,
					art, culture, civilization, architecture, fashion, technology,
					philosophy, etc. Some books are for serious reading, some are
					intended to enrich our knowledge and learning. Many books give us
					an insight into various aspect of life. Books on travel and
					adventure infuse into us a spirit of fearlessness and adventure.
					The reading of novels is a pleasant pastime for many of us. This
					provides an escape from the din and bustle of life. One is
					completely lost in the company of good books. There is no sphere of
					life which has not been explored by the books.</p>
				<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Books are good source of
					dissemination of useful ideas. They are effective tools to
					popularize the fruits of our research in various fields of
					knowledge. They help in the spread of our progressive views. They
					are reservoir of knowledge and information. They pass the knowledge
					and information from generation and generation. In fact, no single
					labour of human fruit has been as helpful to the advancement of
					civilization as books. Books are written in all languages of the
					world.</p>
				<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus, books are a blessing. They are
					the treasure richer than the treasure of the king. This treasure is
					inexhaustible. They are the gold mines of art, literature, science
					and information. We should develop a habit of reading. It is good
					for us and society as well.</p>
